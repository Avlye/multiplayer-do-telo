# Motivations

As an entry-level software developer, I have tried so many game engines, including [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

I decided to create an alternative version from his tutorial to learn some foundations of software development.
I started to apply what I learned from TypeScript and recreating some design choices of previous game engines that I already used.

## Front End
