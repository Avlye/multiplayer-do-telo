# Motivations

As an entry-level software developer, I have tried so many game engines, including Scratch, Unity, and Unreal Engine.

I decided to create an alternative version from his tutorial to learn some foundations of software developing, starting applying what I learned from TypeScratch and trying to recreate some design features of previous game engines that I already used.

## Front End
